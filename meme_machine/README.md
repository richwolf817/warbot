# Solana Tracker in Rust

This project is a simple Solana tracker written in Rust that subscribes to on-chain logs for a specific token and processes transaction data. It demonstrates how to use the official Solana client libraries in Rust along with Tokio for asynchronous processing. You can extend this code to integrate with trading algorithms, DynamoDB, Timestream, or any other system.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable) and Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- An API key from [Helius](https://helius.dev/) (or your preferred Solana RPC provider)
- Basic knowledge of Rust and asynchronous programming

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana_tracker.git
    cd solana_tracker
    Configure the API Key
    ```

2.  **Open src/main.rs and update the RPC and WebSocket URLs with your API key:**

    let rpc_url = "https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    let ws_url = "wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    Build the Project

3.  **Use Cargo to build the project in release mode for better performance:**

    cargo build --release

## Execution

To run the tracker, provide a token address as a command-line argument. For example:

        cargo run --release -- 6aHAZxCdcorjctjRG79fo3AhYMxCSuVfNHUT985GNnRS

If you do not provide a token address, the program will default to "TOKEN_ADDRESS_HERE" (which you should change in the code).

## Project Structure

How It Works
Session Initialization:
A unique session hash is generated on startup for tracking purposes.

Subscription to Logs:
The program subscribes to Solana logs via the WebSocket endpoint using the provided token address.

Processing:
For each log received:

The logs are parsed.
The corresponding transaction is fetched.
A stub trading algorithm is invoked (you can replace this with your custom logic).
Decisions (buy/sell/none) are logged and stub functions simulate writing to DynamoDB and Timestream.
Real-time metrics are updated.
Async Handling:
The tracker uses Tokio for asynchronous runtime and channels to bridge blocking operations (the WebSocket receiver) with async processing.

Extending the Project
Trading Algorithm:
Replace the stub in run_trading_algorithm with your own logic.

Database Integration:
Implement the functions write_buy_sell_to_dynamo, write_to_timestream, and update_real_time_metrics to connect with your chosen databases.

Logging & Metrics:
Modify logging and metrics collection as needed. The project uses env_logger for logging.

Troubleshooting
API Key Issues:
Make sure your API key is valid and correctly configured in the URLs.

Dependencies:
Ensure you have an up-to-date version of Rust installed. Run rustup update if needed.
